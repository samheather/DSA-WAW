Flighty Mk. 2 by Team DSA
================

Fantastic Air Traffic Control game wtih online multiplayer (server included), face tracking parallax effect and much much more!

Please see releases at the top of this page on GitHub - there's a release of the master branch (runs on all machines) and of the MacVision branch (contianing the FaceTracking Parallax Effect).  

To run the Face Tracking Parallax effect from either the code after building it yourself or using our provided compiler JAR, you'll need to first copy the haarcascade to /tmp/\<haarcascade file name\>.  In the GitHub release, we include all necessary files and shell script to automatically do this and then launch the game for you.

(Face Tracking Parallax effect requires a Mac with a webcam, running Java 8).
